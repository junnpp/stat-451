    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group will be analyzing an NBA Player Performance Stats dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabdulw/nba-player-performance-stats) . The dataset contains 649 rows, indicating the total number of players, and 29 columns that are key performance indicators (KPIs) for each player. These KPIs include FG (field goals), 3P (3-point field goal attempts), and 2P (2-point field goal attempts). The goal of this project is to use the data to predict the performance of, or identify award-winning players in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, our group will utilize linear regression to quantify which variables among the selected columns are more likely to help us detect better performers, since the majority of the columns are either integers or floats. Then, we will apply logistic regression to determine the probability of a player receiving an award or performing better in the 2023-24 NBA season. Before diving into the analysis, we will convert the Tm column into integers using OneHotEncoding to use the variable for further study.\n",
    "\n",
    "While analyzing the dataset, our group is unsure which columns to use for prediction, but we have identified a few variables that are meaningless for our purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player: a unique variable indicating the name of a player."
